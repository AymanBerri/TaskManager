// If you already have the APIs set up in your controller, it makes sense to 
    // use them instead of interacting directly with the database in your Razor 
    // Pages. This way, you can follow a more RESTful approach and keep the logic 
    // centralized in your API controller, which is great for scalability and 
    // maintainability.
